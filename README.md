## ABOUT DATASET
>   <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+"> [DATASET LINK UCI ML REPOSITORY] </a>

 Experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature,Humidity,Light and CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute

## ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION
date time year-month-day hour:minute:second
Temperature, in Celsius
Relative Humidity, %
Light, in Lux
CO2, in ppm
Humidity Ratio, Derived quantity from temperature and relative humidity, in kgwater-vapor/kg-air
Occupancy, 0 or 1, 0 for not occupied, 1 for occupied status
